The file "nexa_funding_received_2016.csv" reports detailed information about all funding overcoming 1000 Euros received during 2016, including date, source, type, and other dimensions. As such, it fulfills point 1. of the Nexa Center's transparency and accountability principles (available at http://nexa.polito.it/transparency-and-accountability). It should be noted that the amounts reported are higher than the ones actually available to the Nexa Center, since they refer to money tranfers to Politecnico di Torino, and therefore do not encompass overhead deductions by the Department of Control and Computer Engineering. Such overhead mainly depends on the type of contract.
